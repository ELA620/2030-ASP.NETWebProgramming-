Lab 03 Instructions
Project 3-1: Style the Price Quotation app
For this project, you will use Bootstrap to improve the appearance of the app described in project 2-1. When
you’re done, the app should appear as shown below.
Specifications
1. Use a horizontal form for small, medium and large (tablets, desktops, large desktops) screen sizes. For
this form to lay out properly, you should:
a. For each row, use a <div> element that’s assigned to the row and form-group classes.
b. Code each <input> element within a <div> element that’s assigned to the correct col
class.
c. Display a validation message in the third column.
d. Note: In the first printing of this book, the code in figures 3-7 and 3-10 isn’t correct. It should
be coded as described by the corrections PDF that you can download from murach.com.
2. Use a vertical form on extra small screens (phones).
3. Start the page with a jumbotron component that uses one of Bootstrap’s context classes to set the
background color. In addition, it should center the text and make it white.
4. In the jumbotron, specify an <h1> element that displays the name of the app and a Font Awesome
icon named money-bill-alt.
5. Style the Calculate button and the Clear link as buttons and set their background color to the same
color that’s used by the jumbotron.
6. Display the validation messages in red.
7. Add margin and/or padding between elements as needed to improve the look of the form.
8. Override the Bootstrap style for the <h1> element in the jumbotron so that its font size is 4 rem units.
